# Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru

This repository contains an example web application built based on the [Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru) online course.

The application is a simple Spring Boot 2 / Spring Framework 5 web application.
The source code is heavily commented (most likely more than necessary), since I'm new to Java programming in general. Therefore, I use this project and the online course mentioned above to familiarize myself with the overall Java syntax and the Spring framework simultaneously.
